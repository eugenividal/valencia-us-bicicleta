# Potential title

Cycling growth in Valencia: a quantitative analysis after seven years of investment in cycling infrastructure (and other sustainable transport measures).

<!-- Alternative title: 'From Grand Prix (2013) to European Green Capital (2024)' -->

# Some context

Valencia has gone from being one of the most car-oriented Spanish cities (it hosted the Grand Prix in 2013!), to becoming a benchmark in cycling in the Mediterranean area in less than 10 years. The fundamental reason, the change of government in 2015 that promoted a set of courageous policies for social and environmental transformation. For this and for another environmental achievements, it has just been nominated European Green Capital 2024.
