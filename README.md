<!-- Cycling growth in Valencia city: a quantitative analysis after seven years of investment in cycling infrastructure (and other sustainable transport measures). -->
<!-- Alternative title: 'From Grand Prix (2013) to European Green Capital (2024)' -->

# Background

Valencia has gone in less than 10 years from being one of the most
car-oriented Spanish cities (it hosted the Grand Prix in 2013!) to
becoming a benchmark in cycling in the Mediterranean area. This rapid
change is mainly due to a set of courageous social and environmental
transformation policies (e.g.Â investment in cycling infrastructure,
bikesharing system, traffic calming measures, etc.) carried out by the
municipal government that came to power in 2015. For this and other
environmental achievements it has just been nominated European Green
Capital 2024.
